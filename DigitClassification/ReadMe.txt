What these files do?
- In this code I tried to create a Perceptron and trained to classify digits.
- Since this class is Non-Linear and Perceptron can only classify Linear Sets, many assumptions were made.
Assumptions:
- Error will never converge to zero. We terminate the code when error drops below some threshold value.
- Largest Induced Local field will be used as the Output/Predicted Digit.
