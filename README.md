  Perceptron Learning Algorithm
  1 - This Repo contains two sets of code, one for classifying MNIST Digit Dataset and another simple 2D Two Linearly Separable classes.
  2 - Main objective of this code is for learning how to write a program for Perceptron Learning Algorithm.
  3 - MNIST Digit Data is a Non-Linear Dataset. So, many assumptions were made to work around that.
