# Perceptron
Perceptron Learning Algorithm
1 - This Repo contains two sets of code, one for classifying MNIST Digit Dataset and another simple 2D Two Linearly Separable classes.
2 - Main objective of this code is for learning how to write a program for Perceptron Learning Algorithm.
3 - MNIST Digit Data is a Non-Linear Dataset. So, many assumptions were made to work around that.
